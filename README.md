 FPV Drone Warfare in the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict - Data Driven Study 

ðŸ“Œ **Overview**  
This repository documents the evolution of FPV drone warfare (2022â€“2024) across tactical, strategic, and technological levels, with a unique integration of data science and AI tools to extract insight from open-source conflict data.

ðŸ§  **What's Inside**
- A doctrine-based breakdown of FPV drone tactics and countermeasures
- OSINT-backed event mapping, losses (Oryx, NASA FIRMS, DeepStateMap)
- Python scripts for:
  - ðŸ“Š Data visualization (FPV usage trends, terrain impact)
  - ðŸ§® Simulation of FPV vs armor effectiveness
  - ðŸ¤– AI/LLM-based interpretation of military briefings

ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
To bridge the gap between modern conflict observation and data-driven military understanding â€” using open code and verified datasets.
